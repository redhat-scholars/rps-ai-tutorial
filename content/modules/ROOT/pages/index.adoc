# Welcome to the Tutorial!

Welcome to the *Tutorial: Rock, Paper, Scissors! Build an AI-powered Interactive Game With Argo CD and Kubeflow*. We're glad to have you here with us at https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/[*KubeCon and CloudNativeCon Europe 2025*]!

## About this lab

This workshop provides you with your own *Kubernetes cluster* and a series of exercises that teach you how to use OpenShift AI and OpenShift GitOps for an AI-powered interactive game called RoShambo. You will learn how to use link:https://www.kubeflow.org/[*Kubeflow*,window='_blank'] to automate model construction through data science pipelines and deploy models via the model server. You will also learn how to use link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[*Argo CDs*,window='_blank'] to handle the deployment of models and applications using GitOps principles. 

We'll be deploying a multi-component application which includes a frontend built with link:https://reactjs.org[*React*,window='_blank'], a backend using link:https://quarkus.io[*Quarkus*,window='_blank'], and an AI model built and trained with link:https://pytorch.org[*PyTorch*,window='_blank'].

## Introduction

The demo application in this workshop is an interactive game called RoShambo, which allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Scissors, Paper against an AI-powered opponent. You will work with two main components: the AI model and the game application.

By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to deploy AI models using OpenShift AI, automate model construction with data science pipelines, and leverage OpenShift GitOps for deploying models and applications. The workshop includes the following steps:

- Work with an existing OpenShift cluster and access OpenShift AI
- Create a Data Science project and set up a workbench
- Work within Jupyter Hub to work with an existing PyTorch project and explore the various notebooks
- Run a data science pipeline to train the AI model
- Create a model server and test the AI model
- Deploy the AI proxy and game application using OpenShift GitOps
- Interact with the game, both with and without camera input
- Enable the multiplayer feature and play together with other workshop participants
- Explore MLOps automation with OpenShift AI, Pipelines, and GitOps.

== What is OpenShift AI?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai[OpenShift AI,window='_blank'] is a managed cloud service for data scientists and developers of intelligent applications. It provides a fully supported environment in which to rapidly develop, train, test, and deploy machine learning (ML) models and intelligent applications in the public cloud.

== What is OpenShift GitOps?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[OpenShift GitOps,window='_blank'] is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud-native applications using Git as the single source of truth. It enables you to manage and automate complex deployments, saving time during deployment and release cycles. You can use OpenShift GitOps to create repeatable processes for managing OpenShift clusters and applications across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.
