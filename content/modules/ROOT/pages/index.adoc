# Welcome to the Workshop!

Welcome to the *Rock, Scissors, Paper: An AI-powered Interactive Game with OpenShift AI and OpenShift GitOps* workshop. We're glad to have you here with us at https://www.redhat.com/en/summit[*Red Hat Summit*] 2024!

## About this lab

This workshop provides you with your own link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[*Red Hat OpenShift*,window='_blank'] cluster and a series of exercises that teach you how to use OpenShift AI and OpenShift GitOps for an AI-powered interactive game called RoShambo. You will learn how to use link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai[*OpenShift AI*,window='_blank'] to automate model construction through data science pipelines and deploy models via the model server. You will also learn how to use link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[*OpenShift GitOps*,window='_blank'] to handle the deployment of models and applications using GitOps principles. 

We'll be deploying a multi-component application which includes a frontend built with link:https://reactjs.org[*React*,window='_blank'], a backend using link:https://quarkus.io[*Quarkus*,window='_blank'], and an AI model built and trained with link:https://pytorch.org[*PyTorch*,window='_blank'].

## Introduction

The demo application in this workshop is an interactive game called RoShambo, which allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Scissors, Paper against an AI-powered opponent. You will work with two main components: the AI model and the game application.

By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to deploy AI models using OpenShift AI, automate model construction with data science pipelines, and leverage OpenShift GitOps for deploying models and applications. This workshop includes the following steps:

- Set up an OpenShift cluster and access OpenShift AI.
- Explore the RoShambo game model and automate its construction using data science pipelines.
- Deploy the model using the model server in OpenShift AI.
- Set up a GitOps repository and configure application deployment manifests.
- Deploy the RoShambo application using GitOps principles.
- Integrate the AI model with the RoShambo application and test the AI-powered game.
- Explore MLOps automation with OpenShift AI, Pipelines, and GitOps.

== What is OpenShift AI?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[OpenShift AI,window='_blank'] (formerly known as Red Hat OpenShift Data Science) is a managed cloud service for data scientists and developers of intelligent applications. It provides a fully supported environment in which to rapidly develop, train, test, and deploy machine learning (ML) models and intelligent applications in the public cloud.

== What is OpenShift GitOps?

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[OpenShift GitOps,window='_blank'] is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud-native applications using Git as the single source of truth. It enables you to manage and automate complex deployments, saving time during deployment and release cycles. You can use OpenShift GitOps to create repeatable processes for managing OpenShift clusters and applications across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.
