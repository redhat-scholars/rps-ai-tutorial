The RoShambo game supports a multiplayer mode where players are automatically assigned to teams and compete against each other. Let's see who has the skill, and luck, to win the most games!

## Enable multiplayer mode

In order to enable the multiplayer mode for your instance, go to the us delivery tool for Kubernetes provided in the OpenShift GitOps Operator. You can access Argo CD either from the OpenShift Web Console app launcher, or you can visit the Argo CD dashboard using this link:https://argocd-server-argocd-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[*Argo CD Dashboard*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

Access the *rps-game* Argo Application, then from the upper side menu click to *DETAILS*. Switch to the *Parameters* tab and click to *SAVE*.

The backend is re-deployed and the app is now supporting multiplayer mode. Give the frontend URL to your users and start the game from the backend.
