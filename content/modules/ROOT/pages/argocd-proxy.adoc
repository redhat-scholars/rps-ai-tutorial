# Deploying the application with GitOps
:imagesdir: ../assets/images
:sectnums:

In this section, we'll deploy the proxy and game application using Argo CD, a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD follows the GitOps principles, where the desired state of the application is declaratively defined in a Git repository, and Argo CD ensures that the actual state of the deployed application matches the desired state. Argo CD continuously monitors the desired state of the application in the Git repository and automatically applies the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

An Argo CD instance has been already preinstalled and configured in your argocd-{user} in your user namespace. This Argo CD instance comes from the OpenShift GitOps Operator.

Go to the link:{console_url}[*OpenShift Web Console*,role='params-link',window='_blank'], select argocd-{user} project.

You can access the Argo CD web interface by clicking on the Argo CD *route URL*. The URL is displayed in the *Topology* view, and named `argocd-server`.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you access ArgoCD through the `argocd-server` route URL, and *not* the *Cluster Argo CD* route. This is to ensure your permissions are correctly set up.

The Argo CD web interface is protected by OAuth, and you can log in using your cluster credentials:

[source,text,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
{user}
----

[source,text,role="copypaste",subs=attributes+]
----
{password}
----

Then authorize the Argo CD application to access the OpenShift API. Now, you can access the Argo CD web interface and manage the applications.

TIP: Argo CD provides a web interface and a command-line interface (CLI) for managing applications. You can view the status of the deployed applications, perform manual synchronization, rollback to previous versions, and manage application configurations.

## Creating a new AI Proxy application

Next, we'll create an Argo CD application for the AI proxy. The AI proxy application deploys the AI proxy service and the required resources for the frontend and backend microservices to communicate. 

Select *+ NEW APP* from the Argo CD web interface, and fill in the following details:

[cols="1,1"]

| *Application Name*
| ai-proxy
| *Project Name*
| default
| *Sync Policy*

| *Self Heal*

TIP: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and manage applications as packages called charts. A Helm chart contains the necessary templates and configuration files to deploy an application in a Kubernetes cluster.

Hit *CREATE* when finished. After creating the application, Argo CD will automatically synchronize the application and deploy the AI proxy service in the user namespace. You can view the status of the application, the resources deployed, and the synchronization status in the Argo CD web interface.

You can also view this in the *Topology* view, where the AI proxy application is displayed with a Python icon, representing the AI proxy service.

## Next Steps

In this section, you learned how to deploy the AI proxy on OpenShift using GitOps principles with Argo CD. You created an Argo CD instance in the user namespace, configured applications for the AI proxy and the game, and managed their deployment using GitOps principles. Let's now test out the functionality of this proxy through Jupyter Notebooks.
