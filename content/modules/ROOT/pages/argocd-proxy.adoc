## Deploying the application with GitOps

In this section, we'll deploy the proxy and game application using Argo CD, a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Argo CD follows the GitOps principles, where the desired state of the application is declaratively defined in a Git repository, and Argo CD ensures that the actual state of the deployed application matches the desired state. Argo CD continuously monitors the desired state of the application in the Git repository and automatically applies the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

We'll create an Argo CD instance in the user namespace, configure applications for the AI proxy and the game, and manage their deployment using GitOps principles.

## Initializing Argo CD

First, we'll install Argo CD in the user namespace. From the `game-{user}` project, click the *Import Yaml* or *+* button from the top-right corner, copy and paste the following YAML to install Argo CD:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  sso:
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 256Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 128Mi

      tls:
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
        termination: edge

Once the deployment is complete, you can access the Argo CD web interface by clicking on the Argo CD *route URL*. The URL is displayed in the *Topology* view after the deployment is complete, and named `argocd-server`.

The Argo CD web interface is protected by OAuth, and you can log in using the OpenShift credentials (`{user}`, `{password}`), and authorize the Argo CD application to access the OpenShift API. Now, you can access the Argo CD web interface and manage the applications.

TIP: Argo CD provides a web interface and a command-line interface (CLI) for managing applications. You can view the status of the deployed applications, perform manual synchronization, rollback to previous versions, and manage application configurations.

## Creating a new AI Proxy application

Next, we'll create an Argo CD application for the AI proxy. The AI proxy application deploys the AI proxy service and the required resources for the frontend and backend microservices to communicate. Select *+ NEW APP* from the Argo CD web interface, and fill in the following details:

[cols="1,1"] 
|===
| *Application Name*
| ai-proxy
| *Project Name*
| default
| *Sync Policy*
| Automatic
| *Self Heal*
| Enabled
| *Repository URL*
| {gitea_console_url}/{user}/rps-game-manifests.git
| *Revision*
| main
| *Path*
| helmai
| *Cluster URL*
| https://kubernetes.default.svc
| *Namespace*
| game-{user}
|===

After creating the application, Argo CD will automatically synchronize the application and deploy the AI proxy service in the user namespace. You can view the status of the application, the resources deployed, and the synchronization status in the Argo CD web interface.

You can also view this in the *Topology* view, where the AI proxy application is displayed with a Python icon, representing the AI proxy service.

## Next Steps

In this section, you learned how to deploy the AI proxy on OpenShift using GitOps principles with Argo CD. You created an Argo CD instance in the user namespace, configured applications for the AI proxy and the game, and managed their deployment using GitOps principles. Let's now test out the functionality of this proxy through Jupyter Notebooks.
