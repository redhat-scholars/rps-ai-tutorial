# Setup and Overview of the Tutorial Environment
:imagesdir: ../assets/images
:sectnums:

In this section, we'll look at the setup of the Kubernetes cluster (link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift]) we're using for today's lab. This includes *Kubeflow* (link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[Red Hat OpenShift AI]) that have been installed using the OpenShift operators, as well as the projects that have been created for you. We'll look at the operators we'll be using throughout the lab.

## Environment Setup

NOTE: Everything has already been pre-installed on your cluster, so there's no need to do anything here. This is just for reference.

### OpenShift Operators

[%collapsible]
====
We'll use *OpenShift AI* to create and manage our AI/ML workloads. This includes creating and managing AI/ML pipelines, models, and datasets.

====
We'll use *OpenShift GitOps* to manage our GitOps workflows. This includes creating and managing GitOps applications, repositories, and environments.

## Lab Checks

### Web Console to access Kubernetes

First, let's ensure we're logged into the *OpenShift* cluster through the Web Console. You can access the OpenShift Console from the lab's start page, or you can visit the OpenShift Console using this link:{console_url}[*OpenShift Web Console Link*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

You'll be prompted to log in with your credentials, here they are as a reference:

- Username: `{user}`
- Password: `{password}`

Once you're logged in, you'll be at the OpenShift dashboard.

NOTE: If you aren't already, you can navigate to the *Developer* perspective, where we'll be spending some of our time.

### Access Kubeflow via OpenShift AI

Let's also view the process of accessing the *OpenShift AI*. You can access the OpenShift AI dashboard either from the the OpenShift Web Console app launcher, or you can visit the Developer Hub Console using this link:https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[*OpenShift AI Dashboard*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

By logging in with OpenShift you'll use your same credentials to access OpenShift AI:

- Username: `{user}`
- Password: `{password}`

### Argo CD

Let's look at *Argo CD*, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes provided in the OpenShift GitOps Operator. You can access Argo CD either from the OpenShift Web Console app launcher, or you can visit the Argo CD dashboard using this link:https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[*Argo CD Dashboard*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

You'll be prompted to log in to Argo CD, and you can use the OpenShift login button to do so. As a reference, here are your credentials:

- Username: `{user}`
- Password: `{password}`

You'll need to authorize the Argo CD application to access your OpenShift cluster. Click the *Allow selected permissions* button to authorize Argo CD to access your OpenShift cluster. Now, you'll be directed to the Argo CD dashboard.

### Gitea

We'll also be using *Gitea*, a self-hosted Git service, to store our game code and Argo CD application manifests. To access Gitea, visit this link:{gitea_console_url}[*Gitea Link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. You'll have access to multiple *Gitea* repositories that contain the source code and Argo CD application manifests. As a reference, here are your credentials:

- Username: `{user}`
- Password: `{password}`

image::gitea.png[Gitea]

Once logged in, you can access the following source repositories:

- link:{gitea_console_url}/{user}/rps-game[RPS Game,role='params-link',window='_blank']

We also have a repository that contains the ArgoCD application manifests.

- link:{gitea_console_url}/{user}/rps-game-manifests[RPS Game Manifests,role='params-link',window='_blank']

## Next steps

Your environment is now ready to go! The cluster has been pre-configured with the necessary OpenShift Operators, and you have access to the OpenShift Web Console, OpenShift AI, OpenShift GitOps with Argo CD, and Gitea From here, we can wrap up the introduction and begin our lab!
