# Conclusion and Resources

Congratulations on completing the "Rock, Scissors, Paper: An AI-powered Interactive Game with OpenShift AI and OpenShift GitOps" lab! Throughout this lab, you've gained hands-on experience with various OpenShift technologies and learned how to develop, deploy, and manage an AI-powered game application.

## Lab Summary
Let's recap the key points and achievements from this lab:

- You set up an OpenShift AI environment and created a Data Science project.
- You cloned the RoShambo game repository and explored the validation notebook to understand the AI model.
- You ran the data science pipeline to automate the model construction process.
- You deployed the AI model using the Model Server in OpenShift AI and tested its functionality.
- You deployed the AI proxy and game application using OpenShift GitOps with Argo CD.
- You played the RoShambo game in different modes, including dummy mode, camera mode, and multiplayer mode.
- You learned about the technical details and architectures behind each component of the game application.
